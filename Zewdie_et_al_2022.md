#Introduce Original Paper
Zewdie et al. explore the relationship between biodiversity and crop yield (specifically, coffee yield) in Ethiopian agroforestry ecosystems. In their analyses they compare numerous variables including species richness, species composition, and coffee yield. Over three years of steady data collection along various sites with different management strategies, they were able to determine that with increased management of a site came decreased site biodiversity; however, their models also show that coffee yield and biodiversity aren't inherently negatively correlated. They suggest future strategies for coffee management be developed to help maintain site biodiversity.

While their analyses are fairly detailed in the publication and their data are available for public access on datadryad, their code is unavailable. This makes it difficult to replicate their initial results, as shown in this project. 

#Explain technical details of replication of analyses
The data available on datadryad were downloaded and placed into a github repository. Initial inspection showed a detailed readme file explaining each files composition.
