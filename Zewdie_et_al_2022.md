#Introduce Original Paper
Zewdie et al. explore the relationship between biodiversity and crop yield (specifically, coffee yield) in Ethiopian agroforestry ecosystems. In their analyses they compare numerous variables including species richness, species composition, and coffee yield. Over three years of steady data collection along various sites with different management strategies, they were able to determine that with increased management of a site came decreased site biodiversity; however, their models also show that coffee yield and biodiversity aren't inherently negatively correlated. They suggest future strategies for coffee management be developed to help maintain site biodiversity.

While their analyses are fairly detailed in the publication and their data are available for public access on datadryad, their code is unavailable. This makes it difficult to replicate their initial results, as shown in this project. 

#Explain technical details of replication of analyses
The data available on datadryad were downloaded and placed into a github repository. Initial inspection showed a detailed readme file explaining each files composition and was used to select the necessary files for the analysis chosen.

We decided to replicate the analyses that looked at the effect of coffee yield on species richness, specifically woody species richness, herbaceous plant species richness, bryophyte species richness, and total species richness. We then replicated the figure that represents this data (Figure 3: a-d).

We started off by installing and uploading the necessary packages to conduct our work, followed by uploading the .xlsx files needed for analyses ("Plant_species_richness.xlsx" and "Coffee_yield.xlsx"). These files were pulled from the github repository and inspected to determine next steps for analyses.

After uploading and inspecting the files, we learned that all variables for the analyses were numerical, with the exception of Site ID (character). Since the analysis chosen requires species abundance and coffee yield data, the documents needed to be merged. Since Site ID is present in both files, so we used "inner_join" to combine them into one file by "Site ID". We then renamed "Site ID" to "Site_ID" to avoid any potential error.

Next, we ran the analyses using generalized additive models (gam) from the mgcv package. We followed the directions specified in the paper, with species richness as the response variable, mean coffee yield as the dependent variable, a gaussian family with a identity link, and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate the smoothing parameter. Once the analyses were run, they were used to replicate each graph in figure 3. We pulled data from our compiled file (with species richness and coffee yield data) and added mean coffee yield on the x axis and the specific species richness variable on the y axis (woody, herbaceous, bryophyte, and total). We selected geom_point to represent the distribution of the data. Following the manuscript, we added regression slopes with 95% confidence intervals from GAM, shown with solid and dashed trend lines for the significant relationships. The stat_smooth command allowed us to specify a "gam" regression slope, and the stat_cor command added the p-values (p.label) and R-squared (rr.label) values. We also included p.accuracy and r.accuracy commands so our output closely mirrored that of the manuscript. Label.x and label.y commands in stat_cor moved the text to the desired location. Next, we labeled the x and y axes using "labs", specified the theme that closely matched that used in the manuscript, and used "panel.grid.major/minor = element_blank()" to remove the grid lines. Lastly, we specified the y axes to match that in the paper using "scale_y_continuous". The limits command adds the maximum and minimum values of the y-axis, and "breaks" adds the specific numeric breaks. Once individual figures for each species richness type was made, we used the "ggarrange" command to arrange the figures into one final figure in a 2x2 output.

#Summarize your replication of the original results

While our results closely mirror those of the manuscript, they are not exact.  We report a significant effect of coffee yield on woody species richness (p < 0.001) and no effect on herbaceous species richness (p = 0.12) or bryophyte species richness (p = 0.75), which reflect the original results. However, we found a significant effect of coffee yield on total species richness (p = 0.03), whereas the manuscript found a trend (p = 0.06). The R-squared values calculated for the replicated results also vary from the original results for each figure, except for "total species richness".
