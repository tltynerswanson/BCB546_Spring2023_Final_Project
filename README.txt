Here is the brief detail of the attached file
Bryophyte frequency
-	Contains the species-by-site matrix of the frequency of occurrence of bryophytes in the different species sites.
Coffee structure index variables
-	Contains the five variables we measured on 16 coffee shrubs in the sixty sites and the fitted cluster after running cluster analysis with the five variables. 
Coffee yield 
-	Contains the average clean coffee yield for the three years and the mean of the three
Environmental and Management variables
-	Contains three rows with site level coffee structure index, coffee density and coffee dominance values.
Herbaceous vegetation abundance
-	Contains the species-by-site matrix of the herbaceous plant groups 
Plant species and average coffee yield in sites where the species occurs
This file contains the plant species list in the different species groups, the number of sites where the species occurs and the average yield of coffee fro the sites where the species occurs.
Plant species richness
-	Contains species richness of the different three species groups and the total plant species richness for the sixty sites 
Total species composition
-	Contains the species-by-site matrices of the combined species composition (present/absent) of the plant species groups
Woody species abundance
-	Contains species-by-site matrices of the abundance of the woody plant species
